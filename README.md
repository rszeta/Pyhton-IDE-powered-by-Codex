# Pyhton-IDE-powered-by-Codex
This is a very simple Python IDE powered by Codex. Codex can help you to code a single line or a function.
You will need a key.txt file containig your OpenAI API key. If you don't have a Codex API you can still try to autocomplete with GPTJ. Of course it isn't fine-tuned for coding but it is quite good if you want to generate random text.
